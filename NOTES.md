## Notes

- I have completed half of the endpoints in the README (GET /cards and GET /cards/:cardId). Here are a few notes to go alongside my submission:
  - The error handling is currently done within the model - ideally I would look to move this out.
  - For scalability I would use routing in the future.
  - I would eventually provide a list of all available endpoints to the user.
  - I initially approached this challenge using branching and there's a rogue PR for a separate branch. After that I pushed to to my forked main.
  - There seems to be some discrepancies between the json data provided in the folders and the README. The sizing and pages for "card003" doesn't seem to correspond, and cards.json and sizes.json seem to be identical. (Apologies if I'm mistaken!)

Thank you for offering the challenge - I hope I make it through to the next stage.
